        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>The Memory Matching Game is a simple single player game that is meant for all ages.
            When a player starts their round, a timer will begin and will only be stopped when a player
            succesfully matches all their cards. A player can only turn two cards within a turn, if the
            cards match, they will disappear from the page. If the two cards selected are incorrect, the cards will
            flip over, and the player will continue to choose cards until all the cards have been matched. </p>
        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p>Try to finish the game as quickly as possible! Be warned...the pictures will disappear quickly once clicked, so be
            sure to get a good look at the pictures. The faster your time (posted on the bottom of the game
            page), the higher you will be on the leaderboard. Aim for the #1 position, and GOOD LUCK!!</p>
